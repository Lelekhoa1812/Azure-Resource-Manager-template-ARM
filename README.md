# Azure-Resource-Manager-template-ARM-
Simple Azure template structure

This ARM template defines resources such as a virtual machine, network interface, public IP address, and storage account in Microsoft Azure. The virtual machine runs a Windows Server operating system and is connected to a public IP address and a storage account. This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would typically have more complex configurations and additional services depending on the requirements of your application or workload.
